Task 1
------------------


Create an image slider with play/stop, back and next buttons starting from an image list similar to the one in the "slider/test.html" file

The implementation should be done from scratch using JavaScript / jQuery without using any predefined slider component / script.

Here is an example of a slider:

Disregard the text effects and other animations in the example. You just have to create a simple slider with images changing with a left/right slide effect.

Task 2
------------------

In a MySQL database we have a "menu" table that contains the items of a dynamic navigation menu.

The table has the folowing fields:

id - number
parent_id - number - 0 for root
title - string
link - string

Write a piece of PHP code that generates a structure of UL/LI elements for the menu structure from the table described above. The menu should work with unlimited levels of submenus.

Example : 

1 0 about about.html
2 0 products products.html
3 2 product 1 product1.html
...

<ul>
	<li><a href="about.html"> about </a></li>
	<li><a href="products.html"> products </a> 
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="product1.html"> product 1 </a></li>
			...
		</ul>
	</li>
	...
</ul>
